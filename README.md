Miner-monitor
=============
This program allows for minitoring miners based off pool stats.
To have more information displayed besides yuor user name and total hash rate one woukd have to edit the parseResult method in the reader class.

Directions for use.
-------------------
1. unzip folder
2. click the jar
3. enter your api key
4. if your api key changes then just click the update button and enter your new key

it would be fairly trivial to take the reader class and adapt it to work with arduino and in the future i may include that program.
